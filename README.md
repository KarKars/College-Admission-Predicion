<h2>A Linear Regression model which will predict the probability of a student getting admitted into an University</h2>

This project is meant for calculating the chances of a student getting admitted to an University based on the following parameters
1. The GRE Score of the student
2. The TOEFL Score of the student
3. The quality of the Statment of Purpose and the Letter of Recommendation provided by the student
4. His academic performance based on his CGPA
5. His previous research experience

The prediction model uses Linear Regression, and will predict the probability on a scale of 0 (no chance) to 1 (full chance). The model successfully measures the chance with 6.62% error in prediction.

Future commits in this code will include : 
  1. A comparative study of the performance of the different prediction models on the dataset
  
  Suggestions on further commits are welcome.
